# sportshub

Get sport scores on your 3DS.

![sportshub UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sereneblue/sportshub/master/ui.gif?raw=true)

### Controls

	- (X) Refresh scores
	- (Start) Exit sportshub

### Issues

	- sportshub randomly freezes. I think this may be because of sftdlib/sf2dlib.
	- Loading baseball scores doesn't seem to work either. :/
